## Projects I've been working on

1. [A literate programming exploration of DeepMind's DeepQLearning original paper and some extensions](2018-06-DQN-Part1.html). In 2017 and 2018 I spent some time studying ML and reinforcement learning. This documents initial steps through implementing the DQN agent as well the Double DQN extension and some of the theory behind it. 

1. [DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay](https://github.com/liavkoren/ai-ml-rl/blob/master/dqn_implementations/mine/DQN%20part%201.5%20-%20PER.ipynb) and [Distributional DQN](https://github.com/liavkoren/ai-ml-rl/blob/master/dqn_implementations/mine/DQN%20part%202%20--%20Distributional%20DQN.ipynb): **Coming soon.** 

1. I've also implemented a numerical simulation of the [gravitational n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem). This was inspired by Piet Hut and Jun Makino's [Moving Stars Around](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.600.955&rep=rep1&type=pdf) open textbook which teaches the basics of numerical integration. One thing Hut and Makino *aren't* overly concerned with is making cool visualizations. I wanted to be able to fly around in the system and watch it evolve. [This 3d simulation uses three.js to do that](n-body-sim.html).
